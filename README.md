# Portal, but it's OSHA Compliant

Hello! This is where you can download Portal but it's OSHA Compliant.
Please know that you must have Portal 1 purchased and installed on your computer to be able to play this game.


# CURRENT VERSION: v2.6.2

You can download the game from [this page](https://github.com/SparkLinkStudios/portal-but-its-osha-compliant/releases), which has all the current releases. Be sure to download the actual mod folder, not "source code.zip". All releases contain instructions on how to install.

## How to install the game:
1. Navigate to your Steam directory.
> On Windows, this will be something along the lines of `C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/`.
> On Linux, this will be something like `~/.steam/steam/`.
2. Open the `steamapps` folder.
3. Within that folder, open the `sourcemods` folder. If it doesn't exist, create one with that exact name.
4. Extract the game's zip file (downloaded from the releases page above), and drop the internal folder into the sourcemods folder you opened earlier.
> Make sure you are dropping in the internal folder. If you open it, it should contain a bunch of asset folders and files.
5. Reload Steam by clicking the Steam logo in the top left, and then clicking "Exit". Relaunch Steam.
6. You should now see the game in your library!
